# thumbhash_flutter

Flutter/Dart port of [thumbhash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash) encoder by [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw).

A very compact representation of an image placeholder.

## Features
As of now this library only handles the conversion of hashes to images, not the reverse.
